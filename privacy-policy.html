        <h2>2. Hosting and Content Delivery Networks (CDN)</h2>
        <h3>External Hosting</h3>
        <p>
            This website is hosted by an external service provider (host). Personal data
            collected on this website are stored on the servers of the host. These may
            include, but are not limited to, IP addresses, contact requests, metadata
            and communications, contract information, contact information, names, web
            page access, and other data generated through a web site.
        </p>
        <p>
            The host is used for the purpose of fulfilling the contract with our
            potential and existing customers (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR) and in the interest of
            secure, fast, and efficient provision of our online services by a
            professional provider (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR).
        </p>

        <h2>3. General information and mandatory information</h2>
        <h3>Data protection</h3>
        <p>
            The operators of this website and its pages take the protection of your
            personal data very seriously. Hence, we handle your personal data as
            confidential information and in compliance with the statutory data
            protection regulations and this Data Protection Declaration.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whenever you use this website, a variety of personal information will be
            collected. Personal data comprises data that can be used to personally
            identify you. This Data Protection Declaration explains which data we
            collect as well as the purposes we use this data for. It also explains how,
            and for which purpose the information is collected.
        </p>
        <p>
            We herewith advise you that the transmission of data via the Internet (i.e.,
            through e-mail communications) may be prone to security gaps. It is not
            possible to completely protect data against third-party access.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Information about the responsible party (referred to as the “controller” in
            the GDPR)
        </h3>
        <p>The data processing controller on this website is:</p>
        <p>
            ALCiDES Robots GmbH<br />
            Josefstraße 10<br />
            51377 Leverkusen<br />
            Germany
        </p>

        <p>
            Phone:0049 (0) 214 314 997 0<br />
            E-mail: info@alcides-robots.com
        </p>
        <p>
            The controller is the natural person or legal entity that single-handedly or
            jointly with others makes decisions as to the purposes of and resources for
            the processing of personal data (e.g., names, e-mail addresses, etc.).
        </p>

        <h3>Storage duration</h3>
        <p>
            Unless a more specific storage period has been specified in this privacy
            policy, your personal data will remain with us until the purpose for which
            it was collected no longer applies. If you assert a justified request for
            deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be
            deleted, unless we have other legally permissible reasons for storing your
            personal data (e.g., tax or commercial law retention periods); in the latter
            case, the deletion will take place after these reasons cease to apply.
        </p>
        <h3>Designation of a data protection officer as mandated by law</h3>
        <p>We have appointed a data protection officer for our company.</p>
        <p>
            FirstName LastName<br />
            CompanyName GmbH <br />
            StreetName Number<br />
            ZipCode City<br />

        </p>
        <h3>Information on data transfer to the USA and other non-EU countries</h3>
        <p>
            Among other things, tools of companies domiciled in the United States or
            other from a data protection perspective non-secure non-EU countries, are
            integrated into our website. If these tools are active, your personal data
            may potentially be transferred to these non-EU countries and may be
            processed there. We must point out that in these countries, a data
            protection level that is comparable to that in the EU cannot be guaranteed.
            For instance, U.S. enterprises are under a mandate to release personal data
            to the security agencies and you as the data subject do not have any
            litigation options to defend yourself in court. Hence, it cannot be ruled
            out that U.S. agencies (e.g., the Secret Service) may process, analyze, and
            permanently archive your personal data for surveillance purposes. We have no
            control over these processing activities.
        </p>
        <h3>Revocation of your consent to the processing of data</h3>
        <p>
            A wide range of data processing transactions are possible only subject to
            your express consent. You can also revoke at any time any consent you have
            already given us. This shall be without prejudice to the lawfulness of any
            data collection that occurred prior to your revocation.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Right to object to the collection of data in special cases; right to object
            to direct advertising (Art. 21 GDPR)
        </h3>
        <p>
            IN THE EVENT THAT DATA ARE PROCESSED ON THE BASIS OF ART. 6(1)(E) OR (F)
            GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO AT ANY TIME OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR
            PERSONAL DATA BASED ON GROUNDS ARISING FROM YOUR UNIQUE SITUATION. THIS ALSO
            APPLIES TO ANY PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. TO DETERMINE THE LEGAL
            BASIS, ON WHICH ANY PROCESSING OF DATA IS BASED, PLEASE CONSULT THIS DATA
            PROTECTION DECLARATION. IF YOU LOG AN OBJECTION, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS
            YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA, UNLESS WE ARE IN A POSITION TO PRESENT
            COMPELLING PROTECTION WORTHY GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING OF YOUR DATA, THAT
            OUTWEIGH YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OR IF THE PURPOSE OF THE
            PROCESSING IS THE CLAIMING, EXERCISING OR DEFENCE OF LEGAL ENTITLEMENTS
            (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21(1) GDPR).
        </p>
        <p>
            IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS BEING PROCESSED IN ORDER TO ENGAGE IN DIRECT
            ADVERTISING, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR AFFECTED
            PERSONAL DATA FOR THE PURPOSES OF SUCH ADVERTISING AT ANY TIME. THIS ALSO
            APPLIES TO PROFILING TO THE EXTENT THAT IT IS AFFILIATED WITH SUCH DIRECT
            ADVERTISING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER
            BE USED FOR DIRECT ADVERTISING PURPOSES (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21(2)
            GDPR).
        </p>
        <h3>Right to log a complaint with the competent supervisory agency</h3>
        <p>
            In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects are entitled to log a
            complaint with a supervisory agency, in particular in the member state where
            they usually maintain their domicile, place of work or at the place where
            the alleged violation occurred. The right to log a complaint is in effect
            regardless of any other administrative or court proceedings available as
            legal recourses.
        </p>
        <h3>Right to data portability</h3>
        <p>
            You have the right to demand that we hand over any data we automatically
            process on the basis of your consent or in order to fulfil a contract be
            handed over to you or a third party in a commonly used, machine readable
            format. If you should demand the direct transfer of the data to another
            controller, this will be done only if it is technically feasible.
        </p>
        <h3>SSL and/or TLS encryption</h3>
        <p>
            For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential
            content, such as purchase orders or inquiries you submit to us as the
            website operator, this website uses either an SSL or a TLS encryption
            program. You can recognize an encrypted connection by checking whether the
            address line of the browser switches from “http://” to “https://” and also
            by the appearance of the lock icon in the browser line.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the SSL or TLS encryption is activated, data you transmit to us cannot be
            read by third parties.
        </p>
        <h3>Information about, rectification and eradication of data</h3>
        <p>
            Within the scope of the applicable statutory provisions, you have the right
            to at any time demand information about your archived personal data, their
            source and recipients as well as the purpose of the processing of your data.
            You may also have a right to have your data rectified or eradicated. If you
            have questions about this subject matter or any other questions about
            personal data, please do not hesitate to contact us at any time.
        </p>
        <h3>Right to demand processing restrictions</h3>
        <p>
            You have the right to demand the imposition of restrictions as far as the
            processing of your personal data is concerned. To do so, you may contact us
            at any time. The right to demand restriction of processing applies in the
            following cases:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                In the event that you should dispute the correctness of your data archived
                by us, we will usually need some time to verify this claim. During the
                time that this investigation is ongoing, you have the right to demand that
                we restrict the processing of your personal data.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the processing of your personal data was/is conducted in an unlawful
                manner, you have the option to demand the restriction of the processing of
                your data in lieu of demanding the eradication of this data.
            </li>
            <li>
                If we do not need your personal data any longer and you need it to
                exercise, defend or claim legal entitlements, you have the right to demand
                the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of its
                eradication.

        <h3>Server log files</h3>
        <p>
            The provider of this website and its pages automatically collects and stores
            information in so-called server log files, which your browser communicates

        <p>This data is not merged with other data sources.</p>
        <p>
            This data is recorded on the basis of Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. The operator of the
            website has a legitimate interest in the technically error free depiction
            and the optimization of the operator’s website. In order to achieve this,
            server log files must be recorded.

            The processing of these data is based on Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR, if your request
            is related to the execution of a contract or if it is necessary to carry out
            pre-contractual measures. In all other cases the processing is based on our
            legitimate interest in the effective processing of the requests addressed to
            us (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) or on your agreement (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR) if this has
            been requested.
        </p>
        <p>
            The information you have entered into the contact form shall remain with us
            until you ask us to eradicate the data, revoke your consent to the archiving
            of data or if the purpose for which the information is being archived no
            longer exists (e.g., after we have concluded our response to your inquiry).
            This shall be without prejudice to any mandatory legal provisions, in
            particular retention periods.
        </p>
        <h3>Request by e-mail, telephone, or fax</h3>
        <p>
            If you contact us by e-mail, telephone or fax, your request, including all
            resulting personal data (name, request) will be stored and processed by us
            for the purpose of processing your request. We do not pass these data on
            without your consent.
        </p>
        <p>
            These data are processed on the basis of Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR if your inquiry
            is related to the fulfillment of a contract or is required for the
            performance of pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the data are
            processed on the basis of our legitimate interest in the effective handling
            of inquiries submitted to us (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) or on the basis of your
            consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR) if it has been obtained.
        </p>
        <p>
            The data sent by you to us via contact requests remain with us until you
            request us to delete, revoke your consent to the storage or the purpose for
            the data storage lapses (e.g. after completion of your request). Mandatory
            statutory provisions - in particular statutory retention periods - remain
            unaffected.

        <h2>5. Analysis tools and advertising</h2>
        <h3>Google Tag Manager</h3>
        <p>
            We use the Google Tag Manager. The provider is Google Ireland Limited,
            Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland
        </p>
        <p>
            The Google Tag Manager is a tool that allows us to integrate tracking or
            statistical tools and other technologies on our website. The Google Tag
            Manager itself does not create any user profiles, does not store cookies,
            and does not carry out any independent analyses. It only manages and runs
            the tools integrated via it. However, the Google Tag Manager does collect
            your IP address, which may also be transferred to Google’s parent company in
            the United States.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Google Tag Manager is used on the basis of Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. The
            website operator has a legitimate interest in the quick and uncomplicated
            integration and administration of various tools on his website. If the
            relevant consent has been requested, the processing is carried out
            exclusively on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR; the consent can be revoked at
            any time.
        </p>
        <h3>Google Analytics</h3>
        <p>
            This website uses functions of the web analysis service Google Analytics.
            The provider of this service is Google Ireland Limited (“Google”), Gordon
            House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.
        </p>
        <p>
            Google Analytics enables the website operator to analyze the behavior
            patterns of website visitors. To that end, the website operator receives a
            variety of user data, such as pages accessed, time spent on the page, the
            utilized operating system and the user’s origin. Google may consolidate
            these data in a profile that is allocated to the respective user or the
            user’s device.
        </p>
        <p>
            Google Analytics uses technologies that make the recognition of the user for
            the purpose of analyzing the user behavior patterns (e.g., cookies or device
            fingerprinting). The website use information recorded by Google is, as a
            rule transferred to a Google server in the United States, where it is
            stored.
        </p>
        <p>
            This analysis tool is used on the basis of Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. The operator
            of this website has a legitimate interest in the analysis of user patterns
            to optimize both, the services offered online and the operator’s advertising
            activities. If a corresponding agreement has been requested (e.g., an
            agreement to the storage of cookies), the processing takes place exclusively
            on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR; the agreement can be revoked at any time.

            Convention on the European Economic Area prior to its transmission to the
            United States. The full IP address will be transmitted to one of Google’s
            servers in the United States and abbreviated there only in exceptional
            cases. On behalf of the operator of this website, Google shall use this
            information to analyze your use of this website to generate reports on

        <h3>Newsletter data</h3>
        <p>
            If you would like to subscribe to the newsletter offered on this website, we
            will need from you an e-mail address as well as information that allow us to
            verify that you are the owner of the e-mail address provided, and consent to
            the receipt of the newsletter. No further data shall be collected or shall
            be collected only on a voluntary basis. We shall use such data only for the
            sending of the requested information and shall not share such data with any
            third parties.
        </p>
        <p>
            The processing of the information entered into the newsletter subscription
            form shall occur exclusively on the basis of your consent (Art. 6(1)(a)
            GDPR). You may revoke the consent you have given to the archiving of data,
            the e-mail address and the use of this information for the sending of the
            newsletter at any time, for instance by clicking on the “Unsubscribe” link
            in the newsletter. This shall be without prejudice to the lawfulness of any
            data processing transactions that have taken place to date.
        </p>
        <p>
            The data deposited with us for the purpose of subscribing to the newsletter
            will be stored by us until you unsubscribe from the newsletter or the
            newsletter service provider and deleted from the newsletter distribution
            list after you unsubscribe from the newsletter or after the purpose has
            ceased to apply. We reserve the right to delete or block e-mail addresses
            from our newsletter distribution list at our own discretion within the scope
            of our legitimate interest in accordance with Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR.
        </p>
        <p>
            After you unsubscribe from the newsletter distribution list, your e-mail
            address may be stored by us or the newsletter service provider in a
            blacklist to prevent future mailings. The data from the blacklist is used
            only for this purpose and not merged with other data. This serves both your
            interest and our interest in complying with the legal requirements when
            sending newsletters (legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6(1)(f)
            GDPR). The storage in the blacklist is indefinite.
            <strong>You may object to the storage if your interests outweigh our legitimate

        </p>
        <h3>MailChimp</h3>
        <p>
            This website uses the services of MailChimp to send out its newsletters. The
            provider is the Rocket Science Group LLC, 675 Ponce De Leon Ave NE, Suite
            5000, Atlanta, GA 30308, USA.
        </p>
        <p>
            Among other things, MailChimp is a service that can be deployed to organize
            and analyze the sending of newsletters. Whenever you enter data for the
            purpose of subscribing to a newsletter (e.g. your e-mail address), the
            information is stored on MailChimp servers in the United States.
        </p>
        <p>
            With the assistance of the MailChimp tool, we can analyze the performance of
            our newsletter campaigns. If you open an e-mail that has been sent through
            the MailChimp tool, a file that has been integrated into the e-mail (a
            so-called web-beacon) connects to MailChimp’s servers in the United States.
            As a result, it can be determined whether a newsletter message has been
            opened and which links the recipient possibly clicked on. Technical
            information is also recorded at that time (e.g. the time of access, the IP
            address, type of browser and operating system). This information cannot be
            allocated to the respective newsletter recipient. Their sole purpose is the
            performance of statistical analyses of newsletter campaigns. The results of
            such analyses can be used to tailor future newsletters to the interests of
            their recipients more effectively.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you do not want to permit an analysis by MailChimp, you must unsubscribe
            from the newsletter. We provide a link for you to do this in every
            newsletter message.
        </p>
        <p>
            The data is processed based on your consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR). You may
            revoke any consent you have given at any time by unsubscribing from the
            newsletter. This shall be without prejudice to the lawfulness of any data
            processing transactions that have taken place prior to your revocation.
        </p>
        <p>
            The data deposited with us for the purpose of subscribing to the newsletter
            will be stored by us until you unsubscribe from the newsletter or the
            newsletter service provider and deleted from the newsletter distribution
            list after you unsubscribe from the newsletter. Data stored for other
            purposes with us remain unaffected.

            We use YouTube in the expanded data protection mode. According to YouTube,
            this mode ensures that YouTube does not store any information about visitors
            to this website before they watch the video. Nevertheless, this does not
            necessarily mean that the sharing of data with YouTube partners can be ruled
            out as a result of the expanded data protection mode. For instance,
            regardless of whether you are watching a video, YouTube will always
            establish a connection with the Google DoubleClick network.
        </p>
        <p>
            As soon as you start to play a YouTube video on this website, a connection
            to YouTube’s servers will be established. As a result, the YouTube server
            will be notified, which of our pages you have visited. If you are logged
            into your YouTube account while you visit our site, you enable YouTube to
            directly allocate your browsing patterns to your personal profile. You have
            the option to prevent this by logging out of your YouTube account.
        </p>
        <p>
            Furthermore, after you have started to play a video, YouTube will be able to
            place various cookies on your device or comparable technologies for
            recognition (e.g. device fingerprinting). In this way YouTube will be able
            to obtain information about this website’s visitors. Among other things,
            this information will be used to generate video statistics with the aim of
            improving the user friendliness of the site and to prevent attempts to
            commit fraud.
        </p>
        <p>
            Under certain circumstances, additional data processing transactions may be
            triggered after you have started to play a YouTube video, which are beyond
            our control.
        </p>
        <p>
            The use of YouTube is based on our interest in presenting our online content
            in an appealing manner. Pursuant to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR, this is a legitimate
            interest. If a corresponding agreement has been requested, the processing
            takes place exclusively on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR; the agreement can
            be revoked at any time.

        <h3>Google Web Fonts</h3>
        <p>
            To ensure that fonts used on this website are uniform, this website uses
            so-called Web Fonts provided by Google. When you access a page on our
            website, your browser will load the required web fonts into your browser
            cache to correctly display text and fonts.
        </p>
        <p>
            To do this, the browser you use will have to establish a connection with
            Google’s servers. As a result, Google will learn that your IP address was
            used to access this website. The use of Google Web Fonts is based on Art.
            6(1)(f) GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in a uniform
            presentation of the font on the operator’s website. If a respective
            declaration of consent has been obtained (e.g., consent to the archiving of
            cookies), the data will be processed exclusively on the basis of Art.
            6(1)(a) GDPR. Any such consent may be revoked at any time.
        </p>
        <p>
            If your browser should not support Web Fonts, a standard font installed on
            your computer will be used.
        </p>

        <h3>Google Maps</h3>
        <p>
            This website uses the mapping service Google Maps. The provider is Google
            Ireland Limited (“Google”), Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.
        </p>
        <p>
            To enable the use of the Google Maps features, your IP address must be
            stored. As a rule, this information is transferred to one of Google’s
            servers in the United States, where it is archived. The operator of this
            website has no control over the data transfer. In case Google Maps has been
            activated, Google has the option to use Google web fonts for the purpose of
            the uniform depiction of fonts. When you access Google Maps, your browser
            will load the required web fonts into your browser cache, to correctly
            display text and fonts.
        </p>
        <p>
            We use Google Maps to present our online content in an appealing manner and
            to make the locations disclosed on our website easy to find. This
            constitutes a legitimate interest as defined in Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. If a
            respective declaration of consent has been obtained, the data shall be
            processed exclusively on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR. This declaration of
            consent may be revoked at any time.

        <h3>Google reCAPTCHA</h3>
        <p>
            We use “Google reCAPTCHA” (hereinafter referred to as “reCAPTCHA”) on this
            website. The provider is Google Ireland Limited (“Google”), Gordon House,
            Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.
        </p>
        <p>
            The purpose of reCAPTCHA is to determine whether data entered on this
            website (e.g., information entered into a contact form) is being provided by
            a human user or by an automated program. To determine this, reCAPTCHA
            analyzes the behavior of the website visitors based on a variety of
            parameters. This analysis is triggered automatically as soon as the website
            visitor enters the site. For this analysis, reCAPTCHA evaluates a variety of
            data (e.g., IP address, time the website visitor spent on the site or cursor
            movements initiated by the user). The data tracked during such analyses are
            forwarded to Google.
        </p>
        <p>
            reCAPTCHA analyses run entirely in the background. Website visitors are not
            alerted that an analysis is underway.
        </p>
        <p>
            Data are stored and analyzed on the basis of Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. The website
            operator has a legitimate interest in the protection of the operator’s
            websites against abusive automated spying and against SPAM. If a respective
            declaration of consent has been obtained, the data will be processed
            exclusively on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR. Any such consent may be
            revoked at any time.
        </p>
        <p>

        <h2>8. Custom Services</h2>
        <h3>Job Applications</h3>
        <p>
            We offer website visitors the opportunity to submit job applications to us
            (e.g., via e-mail, via postal services on by submitting the online job
            application form). Below, we will brief you on the scope, purpose and use of
            the personal data collected from you in conjunction with the application
            process. We assure you that the collection, processing and use of your data
            will occur in compliance with the applicable data privacy rights and all
            other statutory provisions and that your data will always be treated as
            strictly confidential.
        </p>
        <h4>Scope and purpose of the collection of data</h4>
        <p>
            If you submit a job application to us, we will process any affiliated
            personal data (e.g., contact and communications data, application documents,
            notes taken during job interviews, etc.), if they are required to make a
            decision concerning the establishment or an employment relationship. The
            legal grounds for the aforementioned are § 26 New GDPR according to German
            Law (Negotiation of an Employment Relationship), Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR (General
            Contract Negotiations) and – provided you have given us your consent – Art.
            6(1)(a) GDPR. You may revoke any consent given at any time. Within our
            company, your personal data will only be shared with individuals who are
            involved in the processing of your job application.
        </p>
        <p>
            If your job application should result in your recruitment, the data you have
            submitted will be archived on the grounds of § 26 New GDPR and Art. 6(1)(b)
            GDPR for the purpose of implementing the employment relationship in our data
            processing system.
        </p>
        <h4>Data Archiving Period</h4>
        <p>
            If we are unable to make you a job offer or you reject a job offer or
            withdraw your application, we reserve the right to retain the data you have
            submitted on the basis of our legitimate interests (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) for
            up to 6 months from the end of the application procedure (rejection or
            withdrawal of the application). Afterwards the data will be deleted, and the
            physical application documents will be destroyed. The storage serves in
            particular as evidence in the event of a legal dispute. If it is evident
            that the data will be required after the expiry of the 6-month period (e.g.,
            due to an impending or pending legal dispute), deletion will only take place
            when the purpose for further storage no longer applies.
        </p>
        <p>
            Longer storage may also take place if you have given your agreement (Article
            6(1)(a) GDPR) or if statutory data retention requirements preclude the
            deletion.
        </p>
        <h3>Personio</h3>
        <p>
            Our website uses plug-ins from "Personio". The provider is Personio GmbH,
            Rundfunkplatz 4, 80335 Munich, Germany. Personio is a service with which
            personnel data and data for job applications can be organized and processed.
            When you enter data for the purpose of an application, this data is stored
            on the servers of Personio GmbH in Germany. Personio GmbH has a ISO 27001
            certification and operates its servers in Frankfurt, Germany. We use
            Personio to store and process data from applicants.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Personio" is used in the interest of optimizing internal processes. This
            constitutes a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit.
            f DSGVO. We have concluded a data processing agreement with "Personio".
        </p>
        <h3>Our social media appearances</h3>
        <h4>Data processing through social networks</h4>
        <p>
            We maintain publicly available profiles in social networks. The individual
            social networks we use can be found below.
        </p>
        <p>
            Social networks such as Facebook, Twitter etc. can generally analyze your
            user behavior comprehensively if you visit their website or a website with
            integrated social media content (e.g. like buttons or banner ads). When you
            visit our social media pages, numerous data protection-relevant processing
            operations are triggered. In detail:
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are logged in to your social media account and visit our social media
            page, the operator of the social media portal can assign this visit to your
            user account. Under certain circumstances, your personal data may also be
            recorded if you are not logged in or do not have an account with the
            respective social media portal. In this case, this data is collected, for
            example, via cookies stored on your device or by recording your IP address.
        </p>
        <p>
            Using the data collected in this way, the operators of the social media
            portals can create user profiles in which their preferences and interests
            are stored. This way you can see interest-based advertising inside and
            outside of your social media presence. If you have an account with the
            social network, interest-based advertising can be displayed on any device
            you are logged in to or have logged in to.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please also note that we cannot retrace all processing operations on the
            social media portals. Depending on the provider, additional processing
            operations may therefore be carried out by the operators of the social media
            portals. Details can be found in the terms of use and privacy policy of the
            respective social media portals.
        </p>
        <h4>Legal basis</h4>
        <p>
            Our social media appearances should ensure the widest possible presence on
            the Internet. This is a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 (1)
            lit. f GDPR. The analysis processes initiated by the social networks may be
            based on divergent legal bases to be specified by the operators of the
            social networks (e.g. consent within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR).
        </p>
        <h4>Responsibility and assertion of rights</h4>
        <p>
            If you visit one of our social media sites (e.g., Facebook), we, together
            with the operator of the social media platform, are responsible for the data
            processing operations triggered during this visit. You can in principle
            protect your rights (information, correction, deletion, limitation of
            processing, data portability and complaint) vis-à-vis us as well as
            vis-à-vis the operator of the respective social media portal (e.g.
            Facebook).
        </p>
        <p>
            Please note that despite the shared responsibility with the social media
            portal operators, we do not have full influence on the data processing
            operations of the social media portals. Our options are determined by the
            company policy of the respective provider.
        </p>
        <h4>Storage time</h4>
        <p>
            The data collected directly from us via the social media presence will be
            deleted from our systems as soon as you ask us to delete it, you revoke your
            consent to the storage or the purpose for the data storage lapses. Stored
            cookies remain on your device until you delete them. Mandatory statutory
            provisions - in particular, retention periods - remain unaffected.
        </p>
        <p>
            We have no control over the storage duration of your data that are stored by
            the social network operators for their own purposes. For details, please
            contact the social network operators directly (e.g. in their privacy policy,
            see below).
